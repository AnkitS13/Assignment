### Nebula9.ai Lead Gen Chatbot and Web Scraper

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to work together to build a chatbot and scrape web content:

scrape_url.py: A web scraper that fetches and filters URLs from the Nebula9.ai website.

prompt_routing.py (main file) : A chatbot powered by LangChain, Chroma DB, and an LLM to handle queries about Nebula9.ai and related use cases.

wbl_demo.ipynb : A basic demo of the RAG pipeline explicitly without any prompt_routing or intent classification.

#### 2. prompt_routing.py
This file is a chatbot for Nebula9.ai, designed to:

Key Features:

Interact with the chatbot via the terminal.
Additional Notes:
- The script uses the Chroma DB for vector storage and retrieval.
